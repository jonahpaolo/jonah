            <h1>OUR JOURNEY</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <div class="journey-content">
                <p>In our fourth year of college as Social Science preservice teachers, a group of us attended the Global Youth Summit at the MOA Arena on March 3, 2017. This event was a turning point for us. The inspiring discussions about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ignited a passion within us to find a purpose and contribute meaningfully to society...</p>
                <p>As the end of the year approached, we decided to change our annual tradition of exchanging gifts in December. Instead of giving gifts to each other, we chose to give to those in need. We solicited funds from friends and relatives, rallying support for our cause. On December 21, 2017, we held our first project, "Unang Gala." We distributed food packs and toy gifts around Manila. Although it was a modest effort, it marked the beginning of something significant. Planning, organizing, and executing this project brought us immense joy and satisfaction, and we knew we had to continue.</p>
                <p>"GALA," a Filipino colloquial word meaning to travel or go from one place to another, encapsulated our mission perfectly. We aimed to travel to different places, identifying where we were needed most and filling gaps with our advocacy and support.</p>
                <p>After graduating and becoming professional teachers, we faced the challenges of our first jobs and preparing for licensure exams. Despite our busy schedules, we were determined to continue our work. In December 2018, we planned our next project upon hearing about a school in Itogon, Benguet, that had been destroyed by fire. Fueled by the spirit of bayanihan (community cooperation) and pakikipagkapwa (solidarity), we embarked on our first out-of-town project. We traveled by bus to Baguio City and then by jeepney to Itogon, bringing 50 school bags filled with supplies and additional materials for the teaching staff. The gratitude and joy from the students and staff upon our arrival were indescribable. This experience strengthened our resolve to continue our advocacy, and we promised to return with more volunteers and support, a promise we fulfilled in January 2020.</p>
                <p>Project GALA flourished, embracing our identity as a teacher-volunteer organization. The year 2020 presented significant challenges. We returned to Itogon in January, and shortly after, the Taal Volcano eruption occurred. In response, we distributed relief goods to evacuees. By March, the COVID-19 pandemic had struck, intensifying our sense of duty to help. We launched the "Help from Home" initiative, supporting informal sectors with food packs and providing PPEs to hospital workers.</p>
                <p>As educators, we keenly felt the impact of the shift to online learning. This led to the launch of the "PedG the Love for Education" project, conducting webinars nationwide to equip teachers for online distance learning. Partnering with GALAcuna, a student-initiated organization, we launched "Buklat PGasa," identifying students in need of gadgets for online classes and distributing bond papers for modula to various schools needed for modular learning.</p>
                <p>Our projects have evolved over the years, adapting to the changing needs of our communities. From 2017 to now, one thing remains certain: there are countless Filipinos ready to share their talents, resources, time, and effort. Every time we faced a challenge, we reminded ourselves, "God will provide," and He never failed us. This unwavering belief has been the miracle that sustains us, allowing us to continue our work. Our legacy is one of loveâ€”love that binds us, keeps us going, and fuels our dedication to our country and our fellow Filipinos.</p>
